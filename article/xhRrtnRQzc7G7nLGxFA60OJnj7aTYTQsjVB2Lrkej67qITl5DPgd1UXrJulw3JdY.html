Romanza&#x2019;s senior design director Jennifer Stevens collaborated with the couple to create a design that blends warm wood tones with soft watercolor accents. Ivory venetian plaster, rich drapery in sea glass, blue grey and pearl tones, and a light oak floor set the stage for the collection of the couple&#x2019;s favorite furniture pieces and objets d&#x2019; art they&#x2019;ve curated over the years.</p><p class="p-text">A large, custom island with a pedestal end blends elements of the kitchen&#x2019;s combination of glossy white and light maple cabinetry, unified by sleek polished nickel hardware and solid surface countertops. The master suite features a distinctive marble veined tile that extends seamlessly into an oversized shower. A luxurious two-person Kohler soaking tub with a unique free-form shape is positioned before a window for dramatic effect, while free floating vanities add an elegant touch.</p><p class="p-text">The great room flows out to a covered outdoor living area, featuring granite counters and natural materials &#x2013; along with the koi pond on full display. Upstairs, the master suite offers a special balcony to showcase views of the pond, pool and the lush backyard below.</p><p class="p-text">&#x201C;Designing this home has been a beautiful collaboration,&#x201D; said Stevens, &#x201C;The homeowner&#x2019;s personality is imbued within every room.&#x201D;</p><cta-atoms-container-inline></cta-atoms-container-inline><p class="p-text">Two additional guest rooms accommodate visiting guests, while a study offers a multifunctional work space featuring a standup desk and a modern barn door to its private bath.</p><p class="p-text">Homebuyers looking for inspiration for interior design choices can visit the 4,667-square-foot home Port Royal custom estate model at 4395 Gordon Drive in Naples or the newest custom model design at 700 Admiralty Parade West &#x2013; both featuring interiors by Romanza Interior Design.</p><p class="p-text p-text-last" id="article-body-p-last">Romanza Interior Design is a full-service, boutique firm with an award-winning team of interior design experts who use innovative ideas and the latest trends in design to capture the spirit of each homeowner.
