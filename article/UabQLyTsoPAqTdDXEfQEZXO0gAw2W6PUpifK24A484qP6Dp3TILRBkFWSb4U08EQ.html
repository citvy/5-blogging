That rise has left homeowners scrambling to protect their waterfront properties, while also dealing with fallout from a global pandemic.</p><p>Even homes that were set far back from the beach just a few years ago have lost entire beaches.

The home is angled toward the lakefront and includes a rooftop bar, theater and outdoor living area with a fireplace. The process is scheduled to be completed this summer.</p><p>When he purchased the land in 2011, Mr. Sobkowiak was drawn to the area&#x2019;s sandy beach and vacation feel. He added a barrier to protect against rising waters when he constructed the four-level, 4,200-square-foot home. But eight years later, it proved inadequate. Water was hitting the steel wall and he worried that waves would spill over the sides to damage the property or flood the street.</p><p>&#x201C;It was a matter of time before we were next,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You could see it coming.&#x201D;</p><p>Many homeowners were caught off-guard by the rising water levels of the past few years because Lake Michigan had a long period of low water from 2000 to 2013, says George Lucas, a Union Pier, Mich., real-estate agent. Then, just as many were ready to take action, the pandemic put things on hold, he adds.</p><p>Lake Michigan shoreline-protection projects typically cost between $200,000 and $300,000 per home and can take months to complete, says Mr. Weykamp who adds that costs typically aren&#x2019;t covered by insurance. About a third of the homes he sees are in immediate risk of damage, with another third needing repairs within the next year, he says.</p><p>Not everyone wins the race against rising waters. After Joan and Bruce Smothers put their Stevensville, Mich., home on the market for $1.5 million in 2019, storms caused irreparable erosion to the bluff underneath the property.</p><p>The couple worried that their 2,500-square-foot house, a second home where they planned to retire, would end up in the water. After weighing their options, they decided not to take on the extra expense of relocating the home farther inland on the property.</p><figure class="with-caption"><img class="size-full wp-image-600652" src="https://na.rdcpix.com/1137142773/1fefa5d9df3c45629d26ccdcc112268cw-c0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg" alt width="2560"><figcaption>Joan and Bruce Smothers are selling a 5.2-acre parcel of lakefront land in Stevensville, Mich., where their home once stood.
