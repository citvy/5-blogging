<p>Overview</p>
<pre> <org>Global Medical REIT Inc.</org> (the &quot;Company,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) is a <location>Maryland</location>
corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of purpose-built healthcare
facilities and the leasing of those facilities to strong healthcare systems and
physician groups with leading market share.

</pre>
<p>On <chron>July 9, 2020</chron>, the Company completed a management internalization transaction
and is now an internally-managed company. See &quot;- Recent Developments -
Management Internalization Transaction,&quot; for a description of that transaction.</p>
<pre> We elected to be taxed as a REIT for <location>U.S.</location> federal income tax purposes commencing
with our taxable year ended <chron>December 31, 2016</chron>. We conduct our business through
an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure in
which our properties are owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating
partnership, <org>Global Medical REIT L.P.</org> (the &quot;Operating Partnership&quot;). Our wholly
owned subsidiary, <org>Global Medical REIT GP, LLC</org>, is the sole general partner of
our <org>Operating Partnership</org> and, as of <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>, we owned 93.81% of the
outstanding common operating partnership units (&quot;OP Units&quot;) of our <org>Operating
Partnership</org>.

</pre>
<p>Impact of COVID-19 and Business Outlook</p>
<pre> The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our results of
operations, liquidity and capital resources as of and for the three and six
months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>. While we are still navigating the actual and
potential impacts the pandemic will have on our tenants and our business, the
sections below summarize management&apos;s view of the potential impacts the COVID-19
pandemic may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and capital
resources, and other various company-specific matters.

                                      -34-

</pre>
<p> Table of Contents</p> <pre>The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures taken by governmental authorities to
contain its spread have resulted in substantial adverse effects on the <location>U.S.</location>
economy, and specifically the healthcare industry. The full impact of COVID-19
on the <location>U.S.</location> economy and our tenants&apos; businesses and operations remains unknown,
as the velocity of this economic slowdown and the subsequent job losses are
unique and historical in many ways. While these events have already had a
significant impact on the healthcare industry, we cannot reasonably estimate the
duration and severity of such impact. However, at the onset of the outbreak, we
began working with certain of our tenants that were experiencing significant
disruptions in their businesses to help them navigate these uncertain times,
including assisting our tenants in applying for government financial relief and,
in certain limited circumstances, entering into rent deferral agreements. During
the second quarter of 2020, we reduced our rent deferrals to <money>$1.1 million</money>, which
represents rent deferred from April through <chron>July 2020</chron> that is now expected to be
collected primarily over the period from July through <chron>December 2020</chron>. Because the
extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our tenants will depend on future
developments, there can be no assurance that our tenants will be able meet the
requirements of these agreements, or that these tenants, or other tenants, may
not seek additional relief in the future (including tenants that have withdrawn
from their initial rent deferral agreements). The extent of the impact of
COVID-19 on our liquidity and operational and financial performance will depend
on, among other things, the ability of our tenants to resume regular operations,
including performing elective procedures, and returning to normal patient
volumes. At the onset of the outbreak, many states banned elective and non-urgent medical
procedures. Many states have since lifted these bans; however, the recent
resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many states, including many states in which our
facilities are located, may cause such states to reinstitute these bans. Given
that many of our tenants depend on elective and non-urgent medical procedures as
a major source of revenue, a reinstituted ban on these procedures will have a
material adverse effect on our tenants&apos; businesses. In addition, in response to
the recent resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state and federal
agencies have or may reinstitute stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, which
have resulted, and may in the future result, in many of our tenants experiencing
significantly reduced patient volumes and, when such bans and restrictions are
lifted, patients may be reluctant to undertake certain medical procedures and
our tenants may institute social distancing measures, each of which may cause
our tenants to experience decreased patient volumes for an extended period of
time. In addition, if additional government funding is not provided under the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security Act (the &quot;CARES Act&quot;) or new
legislation, our tenants may not be able to rely on future government assistance
programs to withstand the current or another downturn in their businesses. Although we have been able to acquire or place under contract approximately <money>$147
million</money> of 2020 acquisitions, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant
negative impact on the real estate market and our current acquisition pipeline.
A prolonged period of market disruption could have a material adverse effect on
our acquisition growth. As of <chron>July 31, 2020</chron>, we had cash balances and available capacity under our
Credit Facility of approximately <money>$128 million</money>. We will seek to maximize our
liquidity during current market conditions through cash from our operations,
credit facility drawdowns and, when possible, managing the timing of property
acquisitions. In addition, we believe that we could issue equity to support our
liquidity needs.

</pre>
<p>Our Business Objectives and Investment Strategy</p> <p>Our principal business objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns
to our stockholders through a combination of (i) reliable dividends and
(ii) long-term capital appreciation. Our primary strategies to achieve our
business objective are to:</p> <p> construct a property portfolio that consists substantially of medical office</p> <p> buildings (MOBs), specialty hospitals, in-patient rehabilitation facilities</p> <p> ? (IRFs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), that are primarily located in</p> <p> secondary markets and are situated to take advantage of the aging of the <location>U.S.</location></p> <p> population and the decentralization of healthcare;</p> <p> focus on practice types that will be utilized by an aging population and are</p> <p> ? highly dependent on their purpose-built real estate to deliver core medical</p> <p> procedures, such as cardiovascular treatment, rehabilitation, eye surgery,</p> <p> gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics;</p> <p> set aside a portion of our property portfolio for opportunistic acquisitions,</p> <p> including (i) certain acute-care hospitals and long-term acute care facilities</p> <p> ? (LTACs), that we believe provide premium, risk-adjusted returns and (ii) health</p> <p> system corporate office and administrative buildings, which we believe will</p> <p> help us develop relationships with larger health systems;</p> <p> ? lease our facilities under long-term, triple-net leases with contractual annual</p> <p> rent escalations;</p> <p> ? lease each facility to medical providers with a track record of successfully</p> <pre>   managing excellent clinical and profitable practices; and

Recent Developments
</pre> <p>Management Internalization Transaction</p>
<pre> On <chron>July 9, 2020</chron>, the Company internalized the functions performed by its Advisor
by acquiring <org>Inter-American Group Holdings Inc.</org> (&quot;IAGH&quot;), which is the parent
company of the Advisor (the &quot;Internalization&quot;), for an aggregate purchase price
of <money>$18.1 million</money>, subject to working capital adjustments. The Internalization was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, dated
as of <chron>July 9, 2020</chron> (the &quot;Stock Purchase Agreement&quot;), by and among the Company,
Zensun Enterprises Limited (&quot;Zensun&quot;) and Mr. <person>Jeffrey Busch</person>. The Advisor is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IAGH, which was owned by Zensun (85%) and <person>Mr. Busch</person>
(15%) (collectively, the &quot;Sellers&quot;). A special committee (the &quot;Special Committee&quot;) comprised entirely of independent
and disinterested members of the Company&apos;s board of directors (the &quot;Board&quot;),
after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, determined
that the Internalization was fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
and the Company&apos;s stockholders and recommended that the Board authorize and
approve the Internalization. Upon such recommendation from the Special
Committee, the Board authorized and approved the Internalization. Approval by
the Company&apos;s stockholders was not required to approve the Internalization. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Sellers sold all the outstanding
shares of capital stock of IAGH to the Company in exchange for an aggregate of
approximately <money>$17.6 million</money> in cash paid at the closing, which reflected the net
working capital adjustment. Additionally, Zensun and <person>Mr. Busch</person> pledged an
aggregate of <money>$1.8 million</money> of shares of the Company&apos;s common stock and LTIP Units
of the <org>Operating Partnership</org> to satisfy future potential indemnification
obligations.

</pre>
<p>Employment Agreements and Severance Plan</p> <p>On <chron>July 9, 2020</chron>, a subsidiary of the Company entered into employment agreements
with each of Mr. <person>Jeffrey Busch</person>, Mr. <person>Robert Kiernan</person> and Mr. <person>Alfonzo Leon</person> and
established a severance plan for other employees.</p> <p>Closing of Credit Facility Accordion and Related Hedge Transaction</p> <p>On <chron>July 24, 2020</chron>, the Company received aggregate commitments of up to <money>$100
million</money> from certain of its lenders pursuant to the accordion feature (the
&quot;Accordion&quot;) under its Credit Facility. The remaining terms of the Credit
Facility were unchanged. With the closing of the Accordion, the borrowing
capacity under the Company&apos;s Credit Facility was increased to <money>$600 million</money>,
consisting of a <money>$250 million</money> capacity revolver, a <money>$350 million</money> term loan, and a
remaining <money>$50 million</money> accordion.</p>
<pre> In connection with the closing of the Accordion, on <chron>July 27, 2020</chron>, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap with <org>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A</org>. with a notional
amount of <money>$50 million</money> (the term component of the Accordion), a fixed interest
rate of 0.158% and a maturity date of <chron>August 8, 2023</chron>.

<p>Trends Which May Influence Our Results of Operations</p> <p>We believe the following trends may negatively impact our results of operations:</p> <p> Decreases in our tenants&apos; patient volumes and revenues due to the COVID-19</p> <p> pandemic - In <chron>March 2020</chron>, the <org>World Health Organization</org> declared the outbreak</p> <p> of COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a pandemic. This outbreak, which</p> <p> has spread widely throughout the <location>U.S.</location> and nearly all other regions of the</p> <p> world, has prompted federal, state and local governmental authorities in the</p> <p> <location>U.S.</location> to declare states of emergency and institute preventative measures to</p> <p> contain and/or mitigate the public health effects. Many states initially banned</p> <p> elective and non-urgent medical procedures and have since lifted such bans;</p> <p> however, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many states, including many</p> <p> states in which our facilities are located, may cause such states to</p> <p> ? reinstitute these bans. Given that many of our tenants depend on elective and</p> <p> non-urgent medical procedures as a major source of revenue, a reinstituted ban</p> <p> on these procedures will have a material adverse effect on our tenants&apos;</p> <p> businesses. In addition, in response to the recent resurgence of the COVID-19</p> <p> pandemic, local, state and federal agencies have reinstituted or may</p> <p> reinstitute stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, which have resulted, and</p> <p> may in the future result, in many of our tenants experiencing significantly</p> <p> reduced patient volumes and, when such bans and restrictions are lifted,</p> <p> patients may be reluctant to undertake certain medical procedures and our</p> <p> tenants may institute social distancing measures, each of which may cause our</p> <p> tenants to experience decreased patient volumes for an extended period of time.</p> <pre>At the onset of the outbreak, we began working with certain of our tenants that
were experiencing significant disruptions in their businesses to help them
navigate these uncertain times, including assisting them in applying for
government financial relief and, in certain limited circumstances, entering into
rent deferral agreements. During the second quarter of 2020, we reduced our rent
deferrals to <money>$1.1 million</money>, which represents rent deferred from April through
<chron>July 2020</chron> that is now expected to be collected primarily over the period from
July through <chron>December 2020</chron>. Because the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the
Company&apos;s tenants will depend on future developments, there can be no assurance
that the Company&apos;s tenants will be able meet the requirements of these
agreements, or that these tenants, or other tenants, may not seek additional
relief in the future (including tenants that have withdrawn from their initial
rent deferral agreements).

<p> Fewer acquisition opportunities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although as of</p> <p> date of this report we have acquired or had under contract approximately <money>$147</money></p> <p> ? million of acquisitions in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the market</p> <p> for healthcare real estate, and we have experienced a dramatic decrease in our</p> <p> investment pipeline, which could affect our future growth prospects.</p> <p> Lower patient volumes and increased patient credit risks due to the <location>U.S.&apos;s</location></p> <p> record unemployment levels. The <location>U.S.</location> is currently experiencing historically</p> <p> high unemployment rates. Many unemployed workers have also lost their</p> <p> employer-based health insurance, which is a primary payor for our tenants. The</p> <p> ? extraordinarily high levels of <location>U.S.</location> unemployment and loss of health insurance</p> <p> may cause people to cancel or delay medical procedures even after the COVID-19</p> <p> pandemic subsides, and it is unclear when, if ever, these workers will be able</p> <p> to regain employment or private health insurance. An extended period of high</p> <p> unemployment and loss of benefits could materially, adversely affect our</p> <p> tenants&apos; businesses and thus our ability to collect rent from our tenants.</p> <pre>

</pre> <p> Increase in cost and availability of capital due to COVID-19. The COVID-19</p> <p> pandemic has caused substantial volatility in <location>U.S.</location> and international debt and</p> <p> equity markets and has caused significant decreases in the market prices of</p> <p> equity securities, including our common stock. Given these market movements, if</p> <p> we are able to raise equity capital in the near future, we expect such capital</p> <p> to be raised at a substantially higher cost of capital than existed prior to</p> <p> the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as a result of the uncertainty surrounding</p> <p> the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have drawn down the entirety of their</p> <p> ? credit facilities, which has put stress on lenders to conserve capital.</p> <p> Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current</p> <p> expected disruption in the timing of our rental revenues, it is impossible to</p> <p> predict the magnitude and length of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the magnitude and</p> <p> length of the COVID-19 pandemic exceeds our current expectations, we may</p> <p> experience liquidity issues that we may or may not be able to solve through</p> <p> capital raising or borrowing efforts. If we are unable to resolve any potential</p> <p> liquidity issues through capital raising, borrowings, or cash management</p> <p> measures, we may be forced to suspend or reduce our dividends or sell assets in</p> <p> order to meet our liquidity requirements.</p> <p> Changes in third party reimbursement methods and policies. Even prior to the</p> <p> COVID-19 pandemic, the price of healthcare services was increasing, and we</p> <p> believed that third-party payors, such as Medicare and commercial insurance</p> <p> companies, would continue to scrutinize and reduce the types of healthcare</p> <p> services eligible for, and the amounts of, reimbursement under their health</p> <p> insurance plans. Additionally, many employer-based insurance plans were</p> <p> ? continuing to increase the percentage of insurance premiums for which covered</p> <p> individuals are responsible. We expect these trends will only be exacerbated by</p> <p> the COVID-19 pandemic, as federal and state budgets are likely to be under</p> <p> tremendous stress due to the pandemic and private insurers are likely to incur</p> <p> substantial losses due to COVID-19-related claims and the downturn in the</p> <p> financial and credit markets. If these trends continue, our tenants&apos; businesses</p> <p> will continue to be negatively affected, which may impact their ability to pay</p> <p> rent to us.</p> <p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believed the following trends may positively
impact our results of operations:</p> <p> Growing healthcare expenditures. According to the <org>U.S. Department of Health</org> and</p> <p> Human Services, overall healthcare expenditures are expected to grow at an</p> <p> ? average rate of 5.5% per year through 2027. We believe the long-term growth in</p> <pre>   healthcare expenditures will help maintain or increase the value of our
   healthcare real estate portfolio.

</pre> <p> An aging population. According to the 2010 <location>U.S.</location> Census, the segment of the</p> <p> population consisting of people 65 years or older comprise the fastest growing</p> <p> ? segment of the overall <location>U.S.</location> population. We believe this segment of the <location>U.S.</location></p> <p> population will utilize many of the services provided at our healthcare</p> <p> facilities such as orthopedics, cardiac, gastroenterology and rehabilitation.</p> <p> A continuing shift towards outpatient care. According to the <org>American Hospital</org></p> <p> ? Association, patients are demanding more outpatient operations. We believe this</p> <p> shift in patient preference from inpatient to outpatient facilities will</p> <p> benefit our tenants as most of our properties consist of outpatient facilities.</p> <p> Physician practice group and hospital consolidation. We believe the trend</p> <p> ? towards physician group consolidation will serve to strengthen the credit</p> <p> quality of our tenants if our tenants merge or are consolidated with larger</p> <p> health systems.</p> <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether the above-listed positive
trends will be reinstated or, if so, how such trends may be affected by the
long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Qualification as a REIT</p>
<pre> We elected to be taxed as REIT commencing with our taxable year ended
<chron>December 31, 2016</chron>. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation
that qualifies as a REIT generally is not subject to <location>U.S.</location> federal corporate
income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders,
thereby reducing its corporate-level taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a
substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a
substantial percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property
or interest on mortgage loans. We believe that we have organized and have
operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and we intend to
continue to operate in such a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that
we will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as
a REIT.

</pre> <p>Critical Accounting Policy</p> <pre>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to
use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making
estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available
to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or
interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions
or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting
would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial
statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In
the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results,
adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended <chron>December 31, 2019</chron>, filed with the

Property acquisitions and tenant improvements.</p> <pre>In addition, we require funds for future distributions expected to be paid to
our common and preferred stockholders and OP Unit and LTIP Unit holders in our
<org>Operating Partnership</org>. As of <chron>July 31, 2020</chron>, our Credit Facility consists of a <money>$250 million</money> capacity
revolver, a <money>$350 million</money> term loan and a <money>$50 million</money> accordion. The term of our
Credit Facility expires in <chron>August 2022</chron>, subject to a one-year extension option
that we control. As of <chron>July 31, 2020</chron>, we had cash balances and available
capacity under our Credit Facility of approximately <money>$128 million</money>. Our primary
sources of cash include rent and reimbursements we collect from our tenants,
borrowings under our Credit Facility, secured term loans and net proceeds
received from equity issuances. As of <chron>July 31, 2020</chron>, we estimate that approximately <money>$1.1 million</money> of rent that
ordinarily would have been collected during the months of April through
<chron>July 2020</chron>, will be deferred and is now expected to be collected primarily over
the period from July through <chron>December 2020</chron>. Assuming this level of rent
deferrals, we believe we will be able to satisfy our short-term liquidity
requirements through our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from
operations. In order to continue acquiring healthcare properties and to fund the
Internalization, we will need to continue to have access to debt and equity
financing. We are subject to a number of financial covenants under our Credit Facility,
including, among other things, (i) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of
the end of each fiscal quarter of less than 0.60:1.00, (ii) a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00, (iii) a minimum net worth of <money>$203.8 million</money>
plus 75% of all net proceeds raised through equity offerings subsequent to <chron>March
31, 2018</chron> and (iv) a ratio of total secured recourse debt to total asset value of
not greater than 0.10:1.00. Additionally, beginning at the end of fourth quarter
of 2020, our distributions to common stockholders will be limited to an amount
equal to 95% of our AFFO (our AFFO payout ratio). As of <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>, we were
in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the Credit
Facility. We have analyzed the effect that our current expected rent deferrals may have on
our ability to satisfy the financial covenants under our Credit Facility. Based
on our analysis we do not believe these deferrals would have a material impact
on our compliance with these financial covenants. However, if the amounts of our
rent deferrals exceed our expectations and our tenants default on these rent
deferral agreements with us, our ability to satisfy our Credit Facility
covenants may be adversely affected. As of <chron>July 31</chron>, we have entered into six interest rate swaps with four
counterparties to hedge the LIBOR component of our interest rate risk related to
the term loan. Together, these swaps fix the LIBOR component of the entire <money>$350
million</money> term loan on a weighted average basis at 1.91%. An aggregate of <money>$200
million</money> of the swaps mature in <chron>August 2024</chron> and an additional <money>$150 million</money>
matures in <chron>August 2023</chron>.

</pre> <pre>In <chron>July 2017</chron>, the <org>FCA</org> that regulates LIBOR announced its intention to stop
compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a
result, the <org>Federal Reserve Board</org> and the <org>Federal Reserve Bank of New York</org>
organized the ARRC which identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to
USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The Credit Facility
provides that, on or about the LIBOR cessation date (subject to an early opt-in
election), LIBOR shall be replaced as a benchmark rate in the Credit Facility
with a new benchmark rate to be agreed upon by the Company and BMO, with such
adjustments to cause the new benchmark rate to be economically equivalent to
LIBOR. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when
there will be enough liquidity in the SOFR markets.

Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for
acquisitions, capital and tenant improvements at our properties, scheduled debt
maturities, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, management
fees, distributions, and the cost of internalization. We expect to satisfy our
long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, debt financing,
sales of additional equity securities, the issuance of OP Units in connection
with acquisitions of additional properties, proceeds from select property
dispositions and joint venture transactions.

<p>Cash Flow Information</p> <pre>Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>
was <money>$23.9 million</money>, compared with <money>$16.7 million</money> for the same period in 2019. The
increase during the 2020 period was primarily due to increases in depreciation
and amortization expenses and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset
by increases in the tenant receivables, deferred asset, and accounts payable and
accrued expenses balances for the six months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron> compared to the
same period in 2019. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron> was
<money>$76.0 million</money>, compared with <money>$117.5 million</money> for the same period in 2019. The
decrease during the 2020 period was primarily the result of less real estate
investment activity in the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>
was <money>$58.2 million</money>, compared with <money>$101.8 million</money> for the same period in 2019. The
decrease during the 2020 period was primarily due to the fact that the current
period had lower net proceeds from common equity offerings and higher dividends
paid to our common and preferred stockholders, partially offset by higher net
borrowings on the Credit Facility.

</pre> <p>(1) Includes distributions on granted LTIP Units and OP Units.</p> <p>During the six months ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron> and 2019, the Company paid total
dividends on its common stock, LTIP Units and OP Units in the aggregate amount
of <money>$19,675</money> and <money>$13,467</money>, respectively.</p>
<pre> The amount of the dividends paid to the Company&apos;s stockholders is determined by
the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for
payment of dividends, the Company&apos;s financial condition and capital expenditure
requirements except that, in accordance with the Company&apos;s organizational
documents and <location>Maryland</location> law, the Company may not make dividend distributions that
would: (i) cause it to be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the
usual course of business; (ii) cause its total assets to be less than the sum of
its total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences; or (iii) jeopardize
its ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT. -45- Table of Contents Preferred Stock Dividends The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividend
payments only when, as and if declared by the Board (or a duly authorized
committee of the Board). Dividends will accrue or be payable in cash from the
original issue date, on a cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on each
dividend payment date at a fixed rate per annum equal to 7.50% of the
liquidation preference of <money>$25.00</money> per share (equivalent to <money>$1.875</money> per share on an
annual basis). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be cumulative and
will accrue whether or not (i) funds are legally available for the payment of
those dividends, (ii) the Company has earnings or (iii) those dividends are
declared by the Board.

</pre>
<p>The quarterly dividend payment dates on the Series A Preferred Stock are
<chron>January 31</chron>, <chron>April 30</chron>, <chron>July 31</chron> and <chron>October 31</chron> of each year. During each of the
six-month periods ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron> and 2019, the Company paid preferred
dividends of <money>$2,911</money>.</p> <p>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p>
<pre> Funds from operations (&quot;FFO&quot;) and adjusted funds from operations (&quot;AFFO&quot;) are
non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the <org>SEC</org>. The
Company considers FFO and AFFO to be important supplemental measures of its
operating performance and believes FFO is frequently used by securities
analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs,
many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In accordance with the <org>National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts&apos;</org>
(&quot;NAREIT&quot;) definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with
GAAP before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP Units and LTIP Units,
excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, less
preferred stock dividends, plus real estate-related depreciation and
amortization (excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization
of above and below market leases), and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. The Company did not record any adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures during the three or six months
ended <chron>June 30, 2020</chron> and 2019. Because FFO excludes real estate-related
depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of debt issuance costs
and above and below market lease amortization expense), the Company believes
that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period,
reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates,
operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing
perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net
income or loss.

AFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real
estate company&apos;s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do
not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying
the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it for certain cash and non-cash
items and certain recurring and non-recurring items. For the Company these items
include recurring acquisition and disposition costs, loss on the extinguishment
of debt, recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, recurring stock-based
compensation expense, recurring amortization of above and below market leases,
recurring amortization of debt issuance costs, recurring lease commissions,
management internalization costs, and other items.

Management believes that reporting AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful
supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the
operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. The Company&apos;s FFO
and AFFO computations may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other
REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, that
interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, or that
compute FFO and AFFO in a different manner.

</pre> <p>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</p>
<pre>

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect or change on our financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors. The term &quot;off-balance sheet
arrangement&quot; generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual
arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we
have (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative
instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in
assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit,
liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

</pre>
<p>Inflation</p>
<pre>

Historically, inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of
our healthcare facilities. Many of our triple-net lease agreements contain
provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These
provisions include clauses that enable us to receive payment of increased rent
pursuant to escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the
terms of the leases. These escalation clauses often provide for fixed rent
increases or indexed escalations (based upon the CPI or other measures).
However, some of these contractual rent increases may be less than the actual
rate of inflation. Most of our triple-net lease agreements require the
tenant-operator to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including
common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This requirement
reduces our exposure to increases in these costs and operating expenses
resulting from inflation.
